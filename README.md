### 1. **Destinize — Multi-Role Travel Platform**

**Context**  
An early full-stack platform that introduced real-world challenges around **role-based access control, payments, and API ownership**.

**System Scope**

- Multi-role architecture (Admin, Tour Guide, Tourist)
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Stripe payment processing
- RESTful backend with MongoDB and Mongoose
- Axios interceptors for request and error handling

**Key Learnings**

- Authorization rules must be enforced centrally
- Payment flows require strict backend validation
- Early schema decisions have long-term impact

### 2. **Travello Local Tour — Service Marketplace**

**Context**  
A marketplace system that highlighted the importance of **defensive backend design and API safety**.

**System Scope**

- JWT-protected APIs and private routes
- Custom middleware for MongoDB ObjectID validation
- Centralized error handling via Axios interceptors
- Provider-side workflow management

**Key Learnings**

- Input validation is critical to server stability
- Middleware is essential for enforcing invariants
- Backend failures directly affect user trust

### 3. **Nexus Brand Store — Authenticated Commerce App**

**Context**  
An early commerce-style application focused on **authentication boundaries and user-scoped data**.

**System Scope**

- Firebase authentication
- Protected routes and private data access
- CRUD workflows for products and carts
- Persistent UI state management

**Key Learnings**

- Authentication and authorization solve different problems
- User data must always be scoped server-side
- Clear separation of concerns reduces refactor cost

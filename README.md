### 2. **Travello Local Tour**

#### Unique Feature

- Editing id's on the URL of the browser may lead to the crashing of the server. To address this, I created a middleware named `verifyId` on the server side, which checks if requests contain a valid id. If the id is not valid, it sends a 404 status code to the client side. This error is tracked by the Axios interceptor, and if such an error occurs, the user is redirected to the home page, showing an invalid id toast.

#### Project Features

- In the home page, it contains Banner, Popular Services, Things You Need To Know, Our Memories, and Subscription sections. All pages contain a navbar and footer. Initially, the home page loads four popular services data from the server, which is stored in MongoDB. Clicking the show all button below the popular services section will redirect the user to the services page.
- In the services page, there is a search by service name implemented. Initially, it shows 6 services and a show more button. Clicking the show more button will display all the services.
- In the service card, there is a show details button. If the user is logged in, the user can show the detail page of the service and go further.

- In the show detail page, clicking the book button will open a modal where there shows service information, and the user can input the date and instruction and then purchase the service.
- Users can see their bookings and pending works on the my schedule page.
- Users can also add a service by submitting a form on the add service page.
- Users can see their added services on the my added services page.
- From the my services page, users can update and delete their services.
- If anyone books their services, it will show on their my schedule's my pending work section. From here, they can update the status of the service to in progress or completed. Initially, the status is pending.
- Both email-password and social-based authentication are implemented by Firebase. Only the home page and all services pages are public.

### 3. **NEXUS BRAND STORE**

#### Project Features

- In the home page, it has 6 sections, which are Navbar, Banner, Brands, FAQ, and Contact NEXUS. The home page initially loads brand data from the server, which is stored in the database and shows them in cards of the brands' section.
- The Navbar contains a theme toggle button, user image (if logged in), user name (if logged in), home, add product, my cart, login/logout (depending on the user logged in or not).
- Users can change the theme between dark and light by clicking the moon and sun buttons located at the Navbar. The user's theme preference is stored in local storage so that reloading and reopening the browser will not change the theme.
- Clicking on the brands' cards will redirect you to the respective brands' products page.
- The brand products' page contains a slider containing 4 ads images and corresponding brand products.
- In the brand products' page, product information with detail button and update button are shown.

- Clicking add product in the navbar, the user is redirected to the add product page, where there is a form to add a product. Submitting the form will add that product to the database, which can be later seen in the brand's products page. Add products is a private route.
- Clicking the update button on the products page for each product will redirect the user to the update page, where the data of that product is preloaded and set as the default value in the update form. After updating and submitting the form, it will update the product's information. This update page is a private route.
- Login and register page can be toggled by clicking login below the register form and register below the login form.
- When registering, it checks if the password is a minimum of 6 characters, containing a capital letter, containing a special character, and gives an error toast when these conditions are not met.
